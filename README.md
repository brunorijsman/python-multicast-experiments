# python-multicast-experiments
Experiments to figure out the correct way to code IPv4 and IPv6 multicast groups in Python on platforms with multiple interfaces and where each interface uses the same multicast address and port numbers. This is needed to implement per-interface HELLOs for IP-based routing protocols.
